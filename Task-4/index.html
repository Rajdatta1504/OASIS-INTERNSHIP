            <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$270 billion as of January 2022,[2] Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to the Bloomberg billionaires index[3] and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.</p>
            <p> Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics, then moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion </p>    
            <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company
            </p>
            <p> Musk has been criticized for unorthodox and unscientific stances and highly publicized controversial statements. In 2018, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and agreed to limitations on his Twitter usage. In 2019, he won a defamation trial brought against him by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue. Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and public transport.</p>
            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Elon Musk</h1>
            <p>Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[27] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[28][29] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[30] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[31] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[32] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[33][34] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[35][36][37][38]

                In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[39] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[40] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[28] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup </p>
                <p>In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.[17] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[42] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[43] Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother. According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[42] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[44] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[45] Musk's attempts to become CEO, a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin,[46] were thwarted by the board.[47] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[48][49] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.</p>
                <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the human brain to facilitate its merging with machines. The devices will also reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial intelligence to stay updated. Such improvements could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more effectively.[152][153]

                    At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims;[154][155][156] MIT Technology Review described them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater"</p>
                  <p>In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels.[157] In early 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices as it required no permits.[158] A tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[159] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[160]

                    As a merchandising and publicity stunt, The Boring Company sold 2,000 novelty flamethrowers in 2018.[161][162] The idea was allegedly inspired by the Mel Brooks-directed film Spaceballs (1987)</p>
